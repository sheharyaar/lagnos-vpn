This is a fresh start towards building by SSL based VPN. This is solely-worked on by me, I am not accepting contributions at this time. 

Deadline : 31 December 2023 for a POC

#### TODO

- [X] Overall design of the VPN and the platform agnostic functions
- [X] Bash script to setup tunnel

- [ ] Bash script to setup routes
- [ ] Checkpoint 2 : Send packets without SSL to the client and back

- [ ] Checkpoint 4 : Setup authentication and session management
- [ ] Optional : Userspace and kernel optimisations if needed
