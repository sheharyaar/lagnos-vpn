# Lagnos VPN

This is a fresh start towards building by SSL based VPN. This is solely-worked on by me, I am not accepting contributions at this time. 

Deadline : 31 December 2023 for a POC

#### TODO

- [ ] Overall design of the VPN and the platform agnostic functions
- [ ] Bash script to setup routing tables
- [ ] Checkpoint 1 : Open a tunnel and inspect the packets
- [ ] Checkpoint 2 : Send packets without SSL to the client and back
- [ ] Checkpoint 3 : Send packets with SSL to the client and back
- [ ] Checkpoint 4 : Setup authentication and session management
- [ ] Optional : Userspace and kernel optimisations if needed
